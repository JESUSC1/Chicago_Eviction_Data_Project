2018-2019 Chicago Evictions Data Released 

In May 2019, the Lawyers' Committee for Better Housing (LCBH) launched the Chicago Evictions Data Portal as a resource to help researchers, policy makers, and advicates investigate Chicago's chronic eviction problem using eviction court data for the years 2010 to 2017.

LCBH is expanding it's look at Chicago's ongoing eviction crisis with a new release of data for the years 2018 and 2019.

In this short report, we provide updates on key findings from our three initial "Opening the Door on Chicago Eviction" reports: (reports uploaded to repository)

-Chicago's Ongoing Crisis: quantifying eviction fillings and outcomes in Chicago and the troubling racial disparities found in eviction filings
-Most Families Forced Out for Less than $2,500 Back Rent: exploring the most common reason for eviction: non-payment of rent.
-Legal Aid Attorneys Make the Difference: looking into the impact attorneys have on eviction outcomes

We also discuss some recent policy changes that will impact on future evictions and announce a new report, Eviction Filings, Unemployment, and the Impact of COVID-19, in partnership with Loyola University Chicago's Center for Urban Research and Learning (CURL)

The purpose of this project is to (1) facilitate future research on eviction using this and other similar datasets through data managing & formatting, particularly the conversion of CSV data files to Shapefiles. (2) Provide sample code for methods in geospatial analysis, spatial econometrics, and geo-visualization implemented through open source software stools (e.g., R and GeoDa). (3) Contribute to policy-relevant research in the social sciences by expanding on the work done by LCBH, analyzing factors/data they may have overlooked in their research or failed to report.
